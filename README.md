# Exploit classes
This repository contains classes for exploits and scripts I have created. \
Please open an issue if there is any problems regarding the script itself. \
ðŸ”¨ Please mention me when integrating these libraries. 

## Table of contents
   * [Memory](#memory)
   * [Group rank checker](#memory)

## Loadstring:
```lua
local function LoadURL(Url) -- Let's change the world
  local Payload = request({
    Url = Url,
    Method = 'GET',
    Headers = {
      ['Content-Type'] = 'text/plain',
    }
  })
  return loadstring(Payload.Body)()
end

local MemEdit = LoadURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/depthso/RBX-Exploit-Classes/main/Memory.lua")
```

### Table/Arrary search:
```lua
-- This is an example of a table scan
-- For a table that holds the values: Tased, Crouching

local threadsTable = MemEdit:Scan(nil, "table", {"Tased", "Crouching", "ProneIdle"})
assert(threadsTable, "Table was not found!")

for Name, Thread in next, threadsTable do
  print(Name, Thread)
end
```

### Changing Upvalues
```lua
-- This example shows the manipulation of upvalues

local LocalPlayer = game:GetService("Players").LocalPlayer
local ClientInputHandler = LocalPlayer.PlayerScripts:WaitForChild("ClientInputHandler")

local ScriptBase = MemEdit:GetBase(ClientInputHandler)
local Stamina = ScriptBase:Scan("upvalue", 12)
Stamina:WriteMem(math.huge)
```

### Checking player ranks in a group
```lua
-- Append the group to the watch list
local Watch = GroupWatch:Watch({
  Id = 13824744,
  MinRank = 254,
  -- MaxRank = 255,
  Callback = function(Player, self)
    -- Group data pulled from the Group service will be appended
    print(Player, "is an admin for", self.Name)
  end,
})

-- Scan all players that are already present
-- The script will automatically check newly joined players
-- Only if .Enabled in the options is true
GroupWatch:ScanPlayers()

-- Example of ignoring the group
Watch.Enabled = false
```
